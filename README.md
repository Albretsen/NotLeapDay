# Premise
The game plays a lot like Leap Day, but with a few twist. The camera slowly accelerates upwards, and the checkpoints are vault doors that have to be blown up. Dynamite is picked up a long the way. You need enough dynamite to blow through the vault doors. When you reach the top of a level, you can close a hatch on the tippy top of the volcano, which causes a pressure build up which blows up the volcano.

Setting
High tech corridor inside a volcano.

Character movement
The characters is constantly moving to the right and left. When it hits the right wall, it will turn and walk to the left wall. The player can only jump. (Maybe hold down to stand still???)

Checkpoints
Thick vault doors that can be blown up using dynamite picked up a long the way.
